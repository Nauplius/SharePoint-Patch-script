# SharePoint Patch Script

An updated version of Russ Maxwell's "5 hour" SharePoint Patch Script supporting SharePoint 2013, SharePoint 2016, and SharePoint 2019. Original created for SharePoint 2013 by Russ Maxwell, this script has been updated with a few new features:

* Support for SharePoint 2019, SharePoint 2016, and SharePoint 2013 in the same script
* Support for multiple patch files for both platforms
* Support for pausing/stopping multiple SharePoint Search Service Applications
* It's now a module!
* Retrieve patch metadata from [SharePoint Updates](https://sharepointupdates.com)
* Download patches from the Microsoft Download Center
* Run the Configuration Wizard (`psconfig.exe`) with all of the appropriate parameters

**Usage:**
